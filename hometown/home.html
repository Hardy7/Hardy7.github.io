                    <p>In SpaceHunt, the player commands the Galactic Schooner, OldSpice. The goal of the game is to locate the ancient recipe for Koca-Kola which was stolen by BadMax and his interstellar gang of henchmen, and hidden on an unknown planet in the Pentium System. While it is unknown which of Pentiumâ€™s seven planets (Pentium-1 through Pentium-7) holds the secret recipe, the strong box containing the prize is fitted with a transmitter that sends out a beacon. This beacon can be detected aboard OldSpice when it is within orbital distance of the planet.

                    <p>The player uses the keyboard to control the current drop graphic. The player can control the movement of the graphic (left or right). Then, players can control the speed of the drop. Next, the player also can rotate the graphic (90 degree rotation). When the graphic falls to the bottom of the game space or touches other bottoming graphics, the dropping stops and the player cannot continue to manipulate the graphic.The line is automatically eliminated when the drop pattern controlled by the player fills all the spaces in the horizontal line. In addition, the player gets points each time the player removes a line. In the end, when a graphic cannot fall, the game ends. Whats more, we have reward system. if you get more points, you will have greater probablity to eliminate one line.</p>
